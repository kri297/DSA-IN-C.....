# 📁 Repository Structure
This repository contains implementation of various fundamental data structures:

1.circular_linked_list.c – Circular Linked List operations

2.doubly_linked_list.c – Doubly Linked List operations

3.queue.c – Queue implementation (linear)

4.stack.c – Stack implementation using arrays

5.small_linkedlist[1].c – Sample or basic singly linked list


Requirements
  A C compiler like GCC

  A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks)


Topics Covered
1. Singly Linked List

2. Circular Linked List

3. Doubly Linked List

4. Stack (Array-based)

5. Queue (Array-based)


Purpose
This project is part of my DSA learning journey as a Computer Science student. It helps reinforce core programming and algorithmic concepts through hands-on coding in C.
